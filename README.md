# voice-in-copyright-policy

This project is meant to explore Creative Commons' role in copyright policy debates and venues, including the work around copyright reform and advocacy on topics ranging from TPP to text and data mining to related issue campaigns. We will work to identify issues and partners and take a lead where appropriate.
